# Chat-App

## Setting Up
Before starting up the application, open your client and server folders and install all the dependencies by running:
```md
# Install required dependencies
npm install
```
Now we need to execute the next line on each folder for client and server to start running our app:
```md
npm start
```  

## Getting Started
Now just open your favorite web browser and type your username and Room ID you wish to enter.
