# Chat-App

## Overview
This is a simple chat application made using React, Node JS, HTML/CSS, and WebSockets. The premise of this project was to learn how to use WebSockets to be able to have interactions in real time with another user, in which a chat application came to mind being that it covers all of the topics mentioned. 

## Setting Up
Before starting up the application, open your client and server folders and install all the dependencies by running:
```md
# Install required dependencies
npm install
```
Now we need to execute the next line on each folder for client and server to start running our app:
```md
npm start
```  

## Getting Started
Now just open your favorite web browser and type your username and Room ID you wish to enter.

After you've entered the required fields, you can start chatting with whoever else entered the chat room.
